# Hi there, I'm himasha Randil! 
<h3 align="left">Data Scientist | Cyber Security Enthusiastic | </h3>

An inspired young person who follows his passion.

I landed on a gold mine when I chose to follow the Data Science degree program at General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University, where I could use my passion for mathematics and computer science along with my desire for problem-solving, effectively. Apart from data science, I'm curious about learning computer networks and cyber security. Currently, I'm on my way to becoming a self-taught ethical hacker. This curiosity and eagerness to learn insights in technology daily have served me over the past few years.

I'm well known among my colleagues for never giving up attitude and for my positive mindset. I have experienced firsthand, the difference a pinch of confidence and a positive mindset could bring to your work. As an undergraduate, I personally believe in Steve Jobs's quote "One home run is much better than two doubles." And I consider myself a person who's adaptable to all challenging situations. 

I enjoy meeting new people and hearing new perspectives. Feel free to contact me via LinkedIn. I'm always looking forward to an insightful conversation over coffee.
